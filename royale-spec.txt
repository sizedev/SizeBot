## Size Royale Scenario File
# This document serves as a documentation of the specification used for
# defining a royale, as well as (if implemented correctly) is an example
# of a correctly-formatted document.

## Headers
# Headers are contained in brackets, e.g.: [header]
# Valid headers are setup, bloodbath, day, night, fatalday, fatalnight, feast, and arena.
# Arena sub-headers are denoted by pointy brackets and then a description
# and must be in the [arena] section,
# e.g.: <real kelly> "A Giga-sized Kelly rolls over in her sleep and drools into the arena."

## Comments
# Comments, as you may have noticed, start with #. They (as well as empty lines) are ignored.

## Setup
# The setup header contains only metadata, in the form of:
# autoelim:bool, minsize:size, maxsize:size, deathrate:int, arenafreq:int, unitsystem:s
# Similar metadata structures are used multiple times throughout the document.
# The Setup metadata works as follows:
# * autoelim:bool, where bool is either "True" or "False". Whether or not to eliminate players
# who are shorter than minsize or taller than maxsize.
# * minsize:size and maxsize:size, the heights that will auto-eliminate players.
# * deathrate:i, where i is an integer. Fatal events will occur every 1/i events.
# * arenafreq:i, where i is an integer. Arenas will occur every 1/i rounds.
# * unitsystem:s, where s is either "m", "u", or "o", corresponding to "metric", "US", and "objects",
# respectively. ("objects" is a joke system and should not be used in real play.)
# This affects the sizes printed on the stats screen.

## Players
# The player header and subsequent entries work similarly, with the quoted string
# being a player name, and the following metadata being under it:
# * team:n, n being an integer.
# * gender:S, S being an uppercase letter. Accepts M, F, or X.
# * size:n, n being a size value (e.g.: 5ft6in, or 175cm.) This is the character's starting height.
# * url:s, s being a link to a valid image.
# * attr:s, s being the name of an attribute. You can have many of these.

## Events
# Events are denoted by quoted strings contained under valid headers, one a single line.
# They accept some formatting codes:

### Player Tags
# * %n% denotes a player of number n. All intergers between 1 and the number of tributes specified
# in the metadata (up to 9, see below) must be present in the string, and no numbers outside that range
# may exist.
# * %n:>size% denotes a player larger than or equal to size. e.g.: %1>10ft%. (also available is <).
# * %n:A% -> %n:Z% denotes a player on a team. This ensures the matched players are on a shared
# or differing team. For example, %1:A% and %2:A% will always be on the same team, and
# %1:A% and %2:B% will always be on different teams. If, for example, %1:A% and %1:B% both exist
# in the same event, a parsing error will be thrown.
# * %n:inv:item% will only match a player with the item specified in their inventory. Items must
# be all lowercase, with underscores instead of spaces.
# * %n:attr:name% will only match a player with the specified attribute. Attributes must
# be all lowercase, with underscores instead of spaces.
# * %n:g:S% will only match a player of one of genders S, accepts a combonation of M, F, and X.
# (e.g.: %1:g:M% or %1:g:MX%)
# * %n:elims:>x% will only match a player who has more than X eliminations. e.g.: %1:elims:>2%
# (Also available, elims:<x and elims:=x)
# Multiple player-tags can be added to one player with the & symbol, e.g.: %1:g:M&A%.

### Pronoun Tags
# * %p:n% is replaced by player n's third-person subject pronouns (he, she, they) e.g.: %p:1%
# * %p:no% is replaced by player n's third-person object pronouns (him, her, them) e.g.: %p:1o%
# * %p:ns% is replaced by player n's possesive pronouns (his, hers, their) e.g.: %p:1s%
# * %p:nself% is replaced by player n's self pronouns (himself, herself, themself) e.g.: %p:1self%
# * Replacing p with P will capitalize the pronoun.

## Event Metadata
# The line under a scenario should contain metadata about that scenario.
# All metadata is optional, except for tributes, which must be a valid integer higher than 0.
# * tributes:n denotes how many tributes are involved in this scenario. (up to 9)
# * setsize:n:s changes player n's size to s.
# * size:n:i changes player n's size by i amount. i can be any difference string, e.g.: 2x, /2,
# +1ft, -6in, 50%, etc.
# * elim:n eliminates player n.
# * perp:n denotes that player n eliminated someone.
# * give:n:item gives player n the item specified.
# * remove:n:item removes the specified item from the player n. If the player doesn't have any
# of the item, this does nothing.
# * giveattr:n:attr gives player n the attribute specified.
# * removeattr:n:attr removes the specified attribute from the player n. If the player doesn't have that
# attribute, this does nothing.
# * rarity:f denotes how rare an event is. f is a decimal number, which defaults to 1.
# For example, an event of rarity 0.1 will be 10 times more rare than a standard event.

## The Game
# The game loop proceeds as follows:
# One bloodbath occurs, in which something happens to each player.
# One day then happens, in which something happens to each player.
# One night happens, in which something happens to each player.
# A fatal event can occur randomly within either of these time periods.
# This day-night loop is the core of the game.
# A feast event happens after roughly half the population is eliminated.
# An arena event is rare and can happen at any time.
# A player elims if they are shrunk beyond 1mm, grow beyond 8 miles, or are eliminated manually.

# Below here is an example of an actual game. It is extremely abbreviated, for example purposes.
