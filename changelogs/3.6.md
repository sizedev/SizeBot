# SizeBot 3.6 Changelog

*For the last major version's changelog, see [SizeBot 3½ Changelog](https://github.com/sizedev/SizeBot/blob/master/changelogs/3.5.md).*

To start, I'd like to thank Discord for fixing the long standing bug where nicknames would not update live on Desktop clients. That's been fixed while working on this update, which means your slowchanges and general nick updates should show up in real time in chats now! Now, onto the changelog...

## Additions

- Added a new customizable stat, swim speed, customizable with `&setbaseswim` or `&setswim` (for setting swim speed at current size.)
- Added two new stats, crawl speed and jump height.
- Added `&start`, which allows you to begin moving forward.
  - Used like `&start <type> [stop]`.
  - Valid types are `walk`, `run`, `climb`, `crawl`, and `swim`.
  - `[stop]` is an optional time limit, e.g. `1h`.
  - This command currently will screw up its math if you change height during its operation. This will likely change in the future, but for now, consider this command "in beta".
- Added `&stop`, which stops a current movement.
- Added `&sofar [@User]`, which tells you how far a user has moved so far, if they are moving (defaults to yourself.)
- Added trigger words.
  - Use `&settrigger <trigger> <diff>` to add a new trigger word, e.g.: `&settrigger hello -1in`
  - Use `&cleartrigger <trigger>` to remove a trigger word.
  - Use `&triggers` to see your current triggers.
- Added `&pushbutton`, which lets you push someone's pre-set button to trigger a size change.
  - Set your own button with `&setbutton <diff>`
  - Clear your button with `&clearbutton`.
  - Currently, if you set a button, it will allow *anyone* to push your button. That will change later, but for now, consider this feature somewhat beta and globally accessible.
- Added `&copyheight`, which allows you to copy the height of another user, with an optional factor applied.
  - `&copyheight @DigiDuncan` will make you the same height as DigiDuncan.
  - `&copyheight @DigiDuncan 2` will make you twice as tall as DigiDuncan.
  - `&copyheight @DigiDuncan 1/2` will make you half as tall as DigiDuncan.
- Added `&toggleincomprehensible`, which makes the users size indeterminate, and has funny effects in stats, comparisons, and sizetags.
- Added `&fall`, a command to see how long it would take to fall a distance.
  - Used like `&fall <distance>` or `&fall @User` to see how long it would take to fall the distance of someone's height.
- Added `&sound`, a command to see how long it would take sound to travel a length or a user's height.
  - Used like `&sound <height>` or `&sound @User`, or `&sound` to find the answer for your own height.
- Added `&light`, a command to see how long it would take *light* to travel a length or a user's height.
  - Used exactly like `&sound`.
- Added `&say <message>` and `&sayto <user> <message>`, which relays a message with accurate volume to your scale.
- Added `&math <latex...>`, which lets you show equations as formatted LaTeX, which you'll like if you're a massive nerd.
- Added visibility as a stat and in comparisons.
- Added `gender` as a valid stat in `&stat`, since it wasn't before.

## Changes

- Foot width and paw width are now different calculations. (Paws are wider.)
- Comparisons now have a loading message if it's taking a while to create the embed (which it often does.)
- Adjust how speeds are displayed in stats/comparisons.
- Nicks now truncate species first if your name is too long to fit in a Discord nickname. (Guys, these things have a 32-character limit!)
- You can now use scientific notation and powers in `&setscale`, e.g.: `&setscale 2^5` or `&setscale 1.7E9`.
- Added aliases for some commands that needed them.
  - `&setbasestrength` and `&setstrength` -> `&setbaselift` and `&setlift`
  - `&stopchange` -> `&change stop`
  - `&togglepaw` and `&togglefur` -> `&furtoggle` and `&pawtoggle`
  - `&stat` -> `&get`
  - `&setnick` -> `&setname`, `&name`
- Added and fixed some objects.
- Objects will now definitely match their real name, even if you omit ™.
- Commands are now case-insensitive.

## Fixes

- Some stats were mildly incorrect, and have been fixed.
  - Run speed was too high. (Average speed is now ~6.5mph.)
  - Shoeprint depth was too deep.
  - Climb "pull" distance was too short.
- Lightyears are more consistent, which was never a problem until now.
- `&stat liftstrength` would fail, even though `liftstrength` is a valid stat.
- `&diststat fingerprint` would fail, even though `fingerprint` is a valid diststat.
- Fixed strength being shown in length units sometimes.
- Fixed commas not being valid in size values.
- Fixed sizes starting with `"."` not working properly.
- Fixed large values of X in `X'Y"` not parsing.
- Fixed being able to set your height below 0.001ym.
- Fixed 5'12".


## 3.6.1

- Added `&clearalltriggers`.
- Added the ability to specify a user on `&triggers`.
- Fixed being unable to clear triggers.
- Fixed buttons not saving.
- Fixed usage string for `&setbutton` being wrong.
- Fixed being unable to suggest things in DMs.
- Fixed nicknames not updating if someone triggers you.
- Fixed `&say` showing up as flags for people still using iOS for some reason.
- Fixed `&fall` not working.

## 3.6.2

- Added `&setrandomscale.`
  - Takes a min and max, e.g.: `&setrandomscale 0.1 10`
- Added `&pushme`, which randomly grows or shrinks you by 2-20x.
  - This is basically a mix of `&eatme` and `&drinkme`.
- Added `&simplecompare`, used exactly like compare, which shows only height, weight, and scale.
  - `&lookat` now does this as well when run against two users.
- Added height to the registration process.
  - This should help with the confusion between "height" and "base height." We're open to feedback on this!
- Some errors with triggers were fixed.
- Fixed custom setscale emojis breaking.


## Making a custom scale emoji
`&setscale` accepts a custom Discord emoji as input. You can create your own emojis following the specified format to work with the bot. There are two formats the bot accepts:

* `:sbX:` where X is a number (either an integer, a decimal, or a number in scientific notation.) `&setscale :sb10:` will set your scale to 10x.
* `:sbX_Y:` where X and Y are both numbers. X becomes the numerator and Y the denominator, so `&setscale :sb1_10:` will set your scale to 1/10x.

As an example, I have the emoji ![1/144](https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/793260894686806026.png?size=24) as `:sb1_144:` on a private server so I can use it with the bot.

This may expand, or be deprecated in the future. Consider this feature ALPHA. If this format changes, it will be noted in a changelog.
