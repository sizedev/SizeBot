Remember when I said SizeBot 3 was feature locked? **I lied!** SizeBot 4 is going to take a while and development of the project was on pause for a while.

The good news? **SizeBot is now public!** I'll talk later about what this means, but for now, TL:DR, you can invite the bot to your servers now!

## Additions
- Added `&invite`.
    - Get a link to invite the bot to your server!
- Added `&quake [type] [@User]`.
    - See how big of an earthquake you'd cause with your steps!
    - Valid types are `step`, `stomp`, or `jump`.
- Added `&water`.
    - See how much water you'd consume on a daily basis!

## Changes
- Some stats no longer show up by default in `&stats`.
    - For user's smaller than scale 1:
        - Toe Height
        - Thumb Width
        - Nail Thickness
        - Fingerprint Depth
        - Clothing Thread Thickness
