*For the last major version's changelog, see [SizeBot 3Â½ Changelog](https://github.com/sizedev/SizeBot/blob/master/changelogs/3.5.md).*

*For the last minor version's changelog, see [SizeBot 3.7 Changelog](https://github.com/sizedev/SizeBot/blob/master/changelogs/3.7.md).*

Remember, run `&help <command>` to see detailed usage for all these commands!

Remember when I said SizeBot 3 was feature locked? **I lied!** SizeBot 4 is going to take a while and development of the project was on pause for a while.

The good news? **SizeBot is now public!** I'll talk later about what this means, but for now, TL:DR, you can invite the bot to your servers now!

## Additions
- Added `&invite`.
    - Get a link to invite the bot to your server!
- Added `&setso <from> <to>`.
    - Set your scale to make `from` look like `to` to you.
    - Example: `&statso 20ft 5mi foot` sets your scale so 20ft appears to be 5mi from your perspective.
- Added `&statsso <from> <to> [user/height]`.
    - Get your stats for if `from` looked to be `to` to you.
    - Example: `&statsso 20ft 5mi` gets your stats for if 20ft appeared to be 5mi from your perspective.
- Added `&statso <from> <to> <stat> [user/height]`.
    - Get a stat for if `from` looked to be `to` to you.
    - Example: `&statso 20ft 5mi foot` gets your foot length for if 20ft appeared to be 5mi from your perspective.
- Added `&scaled <object...>`.
    - See how big an object would be scaled up to your size!
- Added `&quake [type] [@User]`.
    - See how big of an earthquake you'd cause with your steps!
    - Valid types are `step`, `stomp`, `jump`, `breath`, `heartbeat`, and `type`.
- Added `&quakecompare <@User> [type]`.
    - See how big of an earthquake someone would cause for you!
- Added `&quakewalk <dist>`.
    - See how many earthquakes you'd cause walking a distance!
- Added `&quaketype <string...>`
    - See how many earthquakes you'd cause typing a sentence!
- Added `&water`.
    - See how much water you'd consume on a daily basis!
- Added spaceship travel time to `&dist`. (Based on the top speed of an Origin 100i.)
- Added prices to some foods in `&food`.
- Added area and volume units to some commands that needed them.

## Changes
- Some stats no longer show up by default in `&stats`.
    - For user's smaller than scale 1:
        - Toe Height
        - Thumb Width
        - Nail Thickness
        - Fingerprint Depth
        - Clothing Thread Thickness
        - Hair Width
        - Eye Width
- Some speeds no longer show up by default in `&dist`.
    - Any speed with a travel time less than 1 second. (Except walking and climbing.)
- Some lengths of time will show less presicion to clean up embeds.
- `&dist` no longer randomly reverses the inputs and now delivers meaningful results for distances shorter than the player's height.

## Fixes
- `&copyheight` no longer requires a factor, and defaults to 1.
- Weight no longer caps out at infinity way before height does.
- `&dist` now works correctly with time values.

## SizeAPI
It seems every update I add a giant feature no one is going to use. From scale emojis to fake users, and now: **SizeAPI!**

[TO BE WRITTEN]

## Public?!
That's right, SizeBot is now public! Anyone can now add SizeBot to their server and mess around with it. Whether you're an RP group, a public community, a D&D guild, an artist looking for references, or just want to do funny math in the privacy of you're own server dang it, SizeBot is now available!

This was a hard desicion for me for a lot of reasons.  
Firstly, I wanted to ensure I was always *in* the servers that had SizeBot; partially so I could help support it, and partially so I knew my efforts were going towards communities that I could help directly. However, now, my involvement with any communities has become largely diminished, and it feels disingenious to continue pretending as if there's much difference between servers I'm in and servers I'm not.  
Secondly, I want the service I've built here to not be linked to me, strictly. I'm not the only one who works or has worked on SizeBot, and I hope that it's usefulness exceed what I alone can do.
Thirdly, I want communities that I would never have thought of; artist groups, D&D guilds, game designers; to be able to use and suggest features for the bot. I am but one person, and my imagination alone shouldn't be the limit for this bot's capabilites.

With that, run `&invite` to get access! I hope you enjoy what I've spent the last many years on.

Love you all.
