Good? news! We're on the way to being a **verified bot!** Unfortunately, that meant having to switch to using **Slash Commands.** Right now, the commands are almost exactly as they were, just using `/sb` instead of `&`, but in the future, we'll have dedicated slash commands for most functionality. Stay tuned for more info on that!

## Additions
- Added a `tier` stat.
- Added `/sb facts`.

## Changes
- `&` commands are now gone! `/sb` (the slash command) is here!
  - See `/sb slash` for info on how to use it.
  - Discord required this for verification -- you'll get a notification as soon as we're verified!

## Fixes
- Fixed slow changes not working!
- Fixed push buttons not working!
- Fixed scale on step not working!
- Fixed `/sb start` not working!
- Fixed several errors with some user inputs.
