## Privacy Policy

Terms are used as defined in our [Terms of Service.](TOS.md)

By using the Bot, you agree that you understand the following:

By running commands using the Bot, the following information is processed:
- Your Discord User ID
- The ID of the Server the command was run in
- The arguments and parameters passed through the command

SizeBot asks for several pieces of information, none of which are intended to be in reference to the User, rather a fictional character created by the User. Any information provided by the User that is in line with their physical, indentifiable self is understood to be coincidence.
At no point will SizeBot ask you for your IP, payment information, personally indentifiable information (as understood by law,) or other such sensitive data.

Some data is retained by SizeBot for the purposes of logging errors, saving user profiles, or calculating output. This data is stored only as long as is necessary to complete these tasks.

If you would like an individual SizeBot profile to be completely removed from our database, simply unregister. Your user profile is deleted automatically.
For any further data removal, or questions regarding our policy, you can contact DigiDuncan (@digiduncan) on Discord, or email digiduncan@gmail.com, subject line "Data Removal".
